253. Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

For example,
Given [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
return 2

Letâ€™s use a min heap to store the end of finished meeting. After this process, the number of elements in min heap is the result.
